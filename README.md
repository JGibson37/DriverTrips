# DriverTrips
<b>How to run the program:</b>

Simply copy and paste a text file named 'input.txt' into the src/main/resources folder. From there, you should only need to compile and run the program from inside your IDE.

<b>Steps for completing the application:</b>

1. I began the project by writing down what I knew I needed to know from the prompt.
    - This included some psuedo coding object structure.
    - I also wrote the "rules" that the program needed to abide by, and gathered the formula for determining speed.
2. Once I began coding I wrote simple tests to create my objects, and in the beginning most of my logic methods were held inside the Trip object.
3. I soon realized that I needed to separate the Trip object from the logic methods and created the TripManager object to house my logic methods.
4. When I was confident I had enough methods to give me the functionality I needed, I moved on the developing the DriverTripApp class.
5. I started with implementing the file input function and created an input file for it to read with the test data from the provided prompt.
6. After I ensured it was working correctly I moved on to creating a String parser so that I could break down the incoming commands.
7. Once successful, I began implementing logic for the commands.
8. Once I believed I was finished, I re-read my prompt and evaluated my code to ensure it suited all the requests.
9. Finally as a last step, I implemented some refactoring to enhance my code readability.

<b>Other learnings included:</b>

Throughout the process I would realize I did not have a certain functionality required from my objects, so I would stop working on the app, implement testing and code for my desired functionality, and then return to the App to continue working on it. This became a cycle until I finally had all the functionality needed to complete the App according to the prompt.

<b>Notes on requirements:</b>
I chose to go to this level of depth based on other coding challenges I have accomplished.
